For my LEND program, I have a practicum placement in which I observe a developmental pediatrician meet, assess, evaluate, diagnose and treat children with various developmental disabilities. Overall the doctor is knowledgeable and really spot on with so much of her care for the families, but she occasionally says things that make my jaw drop. 

The day after Revi and I had the horrible and traumatic onboarding appointment, I observed the developmental pediatrician give her diagnostic findings to the mom of a 5 year old. She provided in-depth explanations and provided her rationale for diagnoses. Before being adopted by his mom, this 5 year old experienced neglect by his caregiver. The pediatrician said that because of this boy's diagnostic profile (autistic and likely intellectual disability), he probably didn't remember and wasn't affected by the neglect. The pediatrician said this in an effort to provide comfort to the mom. 

I believe there is a complete misperception in the medical field that because a child is neurodivergent or intellectually disabled, they are not affected by certain experiences. I think this misperception exists, because many neurodivergent people do not express themselves in a typical or expected way- therefore they must not be affected by something like trauma. Clearly, I disagree and I know that Revi is affected by many experiences. I do think it is displayed in an unexpected way and unlike like many of his neurotypical peers. 

I also know this is a common misperception because I just listened to 2 non-speaking autistic adults use communication devices to discuss their experiences with trauma to a panel of researchers affiliated with an NIH conference. 

This is why self-advocates and family members of neurodivergent individuals are needed in spaces like medical clinics, research panels and places where 'treatment' occurs. To reassure families and neurodivergent individuals that despite how their presentation might be interpreted by others, it is valid and not to be diminished or dismissed.
