            Hi! I am the parent to a 7 year old with a rare genetic disorder and multiple disabilities. 
            I left my career as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in the mental health field 
            to become my childâ€™s primary caregiver. After 7 years away from the professional world, I was selected
            for the 2022-2023 [ACT LEND](https://disabilitystudies.utexas.edu/act-lend) cohort and jumped 
            at the opportunity to merge my personal and professional experiences. Upon completion of the ACT LEND 
            program, I hope to work as a family advocate in a healthcare setting.
