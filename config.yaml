            I am the parent to a 7 year old with a rare genetic disorder and multiple neurodevelopmental diagnoses. 
            I left my career as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker in the mental health field to become my sonâ€™s 
            primary caregiver. After completing the [ACT LEND](https://disabilitystudies.utexas.edu/act-lend) program 
            I hope to become a family advocate that merges my personal and professional experiences.
